# REVYVƎЯ: Reviving the topper in you !
App for IIT Madras Online degree

# Need of REVYVƎЯ
1. LACKING SUPPORT FOR CLEARING DOUBTS THEORY AND TOPIC WISE: The B.S.c course offered by IITM works on the principle of providing lectures and live sessions and the completion of GAs. but it lacks the option of providing support for clearing doubts and issues related to specific topics & sub-topics. 
2. SESSIONS ON YOUTUBE ARE TOO SCATTERED: If a student wishes to refer the course on youtube directly then the links for the various topics and sessions are very scattered and can be at times quite difficult to follow.
3. NO IDEA ABOUT WHERE YOU STAND: because of a missing analysis report in terms of raw data and charts, it can be at times difficult to judge your knowledge of the subjects & where precisely you should work on it.

# Solution Provided by REVYVƎЯ
1. CLEAR IT ALL !
By providing an open environment where you could openly connect with your peers and discuss about methods to clear your doubts, we aim to help the user get there doubts clarified ASAP along with a personalised touch.
2. CLEAN THE MESS !
By providing a curated list of lectures, sessions, and updates in their respective order, we remove the annoyance of having to search for what you were looking for by simply referring to the index in the app.
3. WHERE AM I ?
By providing an analysis report of the student in terms of pie-charts, line charts, stats in various courses enrolled and in which specific part they are lacking, the student gets the exact recommendation on what to work upon and stays motivated.
4. STAY IN TOUCH !
The current notification system through emails is not as convenient and effective as it should be and it may lead to a group of students missing out on important updates. The updates section would provide these through in app notifications.
